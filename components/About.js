    <h1> About </h1>
    Hi! I am Charmaine, born and raised in Sunny Singapore,
    I moved to Vancouver in 2010 to pursue my education in Economics,
    It was then where i discovered my love for data, and during my stint
    working for a financial institution, I discovered my love for code.
    I love helping people and delving into complicated problems and breaking them down into
    smaller(bite-sized) buts to solve them. I have recently moved to Victoria, BC and am looking
    for opportunities especially if it involves Node.js.
